## Objective

The purpose of this in-class assignment is to give you practice analyzing data and visualizing data.

## Tasks, Turning it In, Getting Help

At several points throughout this document, you will see the word **Task**.  

This indicates that you need to do something, generally creating a code block and writing custom code.  

When you are finished, you should save your R markdown file and Knit it as an HTML file.

Upload links to your GitHub folder on ELMS.

## Setup

Take the following steps to set up your document:

1. Download the ZIP file and open the folder inside of your GitHub class assignments folder. It should contain this document, class_06.Rmd.
2. Open this file in RStudio.
3. Rename this file "class_06_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.Rmd".
4. Create a new R project inside of this folder, which will set the working directory in this folder.   

## Load Packages

**Task**: Today, you need to load the following packages.

* [Arcos package](https://wpinvestigative.github.io/arcos/)
* tidyverse
* janitor
* lubridate
* scales
* ggrepel


```{r}
# Load the packages.  You only need to install first if you've never loaded them on this machine.

library(arcos)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(ggrepel)

```

## Load Data

For this exercise, we will be working with a small subset of the DEA's ARCOS database, which documented shipments of 76 billion opioid pills between 2006 and 2012, during the peak of the opioid epidemic.

The data was obtained after a lengthy legal battle by the Washington Post and the Charleston Gazette-Mail, and released by the Washington Post in raw and aggregated form. [Washington Post "Digging into the DEA's pain pill database" page](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/).

A data dictionary is available here: [ARCOS Registrant Handbook](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/handbook/full.pdf).

We will be loading in three different data sets today.  The data was obtained by me from the Washington Post's [ARCOS R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arcos/readme/README.html), which allows you to easily download larger and more interesting slices of the data than what's available using the web interface.  

## Loading Data from ARCOS R package

The data above was obtained by me via the Washington Post's [ARCOS API](https://wpinvestigative.github.io/arcos/).  I then saved it as a CSV and made it available.   

But you can also download data directly from the ARCOS API and work with it.  I'll show you how to do that now.

First, we need to store a password of sorts -- called an API key -- that will give us permission to access their data.  Here's a list of [API keys that will work](https://github.com/wpinvestigative/arcos-api/blob/master/keys/keys.txt).  

Now we can pull down data, using the different functions in the ARCOS R package.

```{r}

# store a password as an object called key
key <- "uO4EK6I"

```

Let's start by just getting the total pills and shipments for each county in the U.S. for each year.  

We're going to store it as an object called "arcos_county_pills_per_year".  We're going to use a function called "summarized_county_annual" and we're going to set the key as equal to the key we just stored.  

```{r}

arcos_county_pills_per_year <- summarized_county_annual(key = key) %>%
  clean_names()

```

### Q1: Total pills by year in Maryland

**Task**: A) Build a bar chart that shows the total number of pills shipped to Maryland (NOT the number of shipments) each year between 2006 and 2014. 

The chart should:

* Make use of arcos_county_pills_per_year data frame we created above. 
* Consist of only one chart with totals for the state, NOT one chart per county.
* Have 9 vertical bars, one for each year between 2006 and 2014. The bars can be any color you choose except royal blue. 
* Label the x axis "Year" and the y axis "Total Pills".
* Give it a title that explains the trend you see, and a source line for where the data came from. 
* The numbers on the y axis should have commas in them.

```{r}

# build maryland_pills_per_year object
maryland_pills_per_year <- arcos_county_pills_per_year %>%
  filter(buyer_state == "MD") %>% # filter to MD only
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(year_pills = sum(dosage_unit))

# plot bar chart for maryland_pills_per_year
ggplot(maryland_pills_per_year) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(year, year_pills), fill="purple4") +
  labs(x="Year", y="Total pills", title="Opioid shipments to Maryland climb steadily, peaking in 2011 before declining again", subtitle = "Total pills shipped to Maryland by year", caption = "Source: DEA ARCOS database, via Washington Post") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)

```

**Task**: B) Answer the following question: how does year-by-year trend in Maryland compare to the year-by-year trend in Baltimore City that you found in the lab you completed for last week? Is it the same? You don't need to rebuild that chart here, just look back at the lab.  

```{r}

# Except for the big peak in 2006, the shape of the trend is similar for Maryland as a whole and Baltimore City - though the state total peaks a year earlier than the city.

```

### Q2: Pills per person in U.S.

**Task**: A) Build a scatterplot that creates a dot for each state (plus Washington, D.C.), its position determined by population in 2012 (x axis) and total pills in that state in 2012.  

The chart should:
* Make use of the arcos_county_pills_per_year dataframe we created above.  To get state population, use the state_population() function that is part of the ARCOS package.
* Have 51 dots, one for each state plus D.C.
* Have a trend line/line of best fit running through the data. 
* Only label the dots for those five states that have a pills per person rate of 65 or greater. 
* Label the x axis "2012 Population" and the y axis "Total Pills 2012".
* Give it a title that explains the trend you see, and a source line for where the data came from. 
* The numbers on the y axis and x axis should have commas in them.

```{r}

# Build state population object
usa_population_2012 <- county_population(key = key) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(year=="2012") %>%
  group_by(buyer_state) %>%
  summarise(state_pop = sum(population))

# Build state pills object
usa_pills_2012 <- arcos_county_pills_per_year %>%
  filter(year=="2012") %>%
  group_by(buyer_state) %>%
  summarise(state_pills = sum(dosage_unit))

# Join population and pills (inner join) to create table with population and pills, and add pills per person
usa_2012 <- usa_population_2012 %>%
  inner_join(usa_pills_2012, by = "buyer_state") %>%
  mutate(pills_per_person = state_pills/state_pop)

# Plot usa_2012 with line of best fit and labels only for pills_per_person >= 65
ggplot(usa_2012) +
  geom_point(aes(state_pop, state_pills)) +
  labs(x="2012 Population", y="Total pills in 2012", title="12 U.S. states received more than 50 opioid pills per person in 2012", subtitle = "Total pills and population by state", caption = "Source: DEA ARCOS database, via Washington Post", fill="buyer_county") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(state_pop, state_pills), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(state_pop, state_pills, label=buyer_state),
                  subset(usa_2012, pills_per_person >= 65))

```

**Task**: B) Answer the following question: which state had the highest pills per person rate in 2012?  What was the rate? 

```{r}

# Kentucky had the highest rate of pills per person in 2012, at approximately 72.2 pills.

```

### Q3 through infinity

**Task**: This is free form practice.  Here's how you should proceed.

* Develop a question you'd like to know the answer to.
* Operationalize the question by writing code in a block below. 
* Visualize your findings with a chart. 

You can stick to using the data you've already pulled in above from the [ARCOS API](https://wpinvestigative.github.io/arcos/) if you want.  But you are encouraged to pull in other kinds of data and explore if you like.  Among the options detailed on the [ARCOS API](https://wpinvestigative.github.io/arcos/) reference page are:

* total_distributors_state() - "Get total pills for each distributor in a state". Possible Q: Who were the top 10 distributors in Maryland? 
* summarized_county_monthly() - "Get monthly summarized pill totals by county". Possible Q: Nationally, do we see a trend of pill shipments rising in December and falling in January? 
* Caution: do NOT use the raw_data() function, it will crash your computer.

You are also free to load other kinds of data, if you want.  Here's one idea: find a spreadsheet online from a reputable source showing opioid overdose deaths by state in 2012 and compare it to pills per person rate in 2012. 

```{r}

# Question: How does Montgomery County's pills per person rate compare to Maryland's as a whole?

# build MoCo pill slice
moco_pills_by_year <- arcos_county_pills_per_year %>%
  filter(buyer_state == "MD" & buyer_county == "MONTGOMERY") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(pills = sum(dosage_unit))

# build MoCo population slice
moco_population_by_year <- county_population(key = key) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(buyer_state == "MD" & buyer_county == "MONTGOMERY") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(pop = sum(population))

# join MoCo slices and add pills per person
moco_by_year <- moco_pills_by_year %>%
  inner_join(moco_population_by_year, by = "year") %>%
  mutate(moco_pills_per_person = pills/pop)

# Build Maryland population object
maryland_population_per_year <- county_population(key = key) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(buyer_state == "MD") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(md_pop = sum(population))

# Join state population and pills add pills per person
maryland_by_year <- maryland_population_per_year %>%
  inner_join(maryland_pills_per_year, by = "year") %>%
  mutate(md_pills_per_person = year_pills/md_pop)

# Join MoCo and state tables to get pills per person for both MD and MoCo into one table
moco_by_year <- moco_by_year %>%
  inner_join(maryland_by_year, by = "year") %>%
  select(year, moco_pills_per_person, md_pills_per_person)

# Plot pills per person by year for Montgomery County and Maryland
ggplot(moco_by_year) +
  geom_line(stat="identity", aes(year, moco_pills_per_person, color = "Montgomery County")) + 
  geom_line(stat="identity", aes(year, md_pills_per_person, color = "Maryland")) +
  labs(x = 'Year', y = 'Pills per person', title = "Montgomery County consistently receives roughly half \nas many pills per person as the Maryland average", caption = "Source: DEA ARCOS database, via The Washington Post", color = "Legend")
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Pills per person", labels = c("Maryland", "Montgomery County"))

```
